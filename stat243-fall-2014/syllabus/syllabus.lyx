\begin_layout Title
STAT 243: Introduction to Statistical Computing
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Fall 2014 (Paciorek)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Course Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistics 243 is an introduction to statistical computing taught using
 R.
 The course will cover both programming concepts and statistical computing
 concepts.
 Programming concepts will include data and text manipulation, data structures,
 flow control, functions and variable scope, regular expressions, matrix
 manipulations, debugging, and parallel processing.
 Statistical computing topics will include numerical linear algebra, simulation
 studies and Monte Carlo methods, numerical optimization, and numerical
 integration/differentiation.
 A goal is that coverage of these topics complement the models/methods discussed
 in the rest of the statistics graduate curriculum.
 We will also cover the basics of UNIX/Linux, in particular some basic shell
 scripting and operating on remote servers, as well as a bit of Python.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the course is taught using R and will teach you a lot about using
 R, the focus of the course is statistical computing more generally.
 Also, this is not a course that will cover specific statistical/data analysis
 methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Informal prerequisites: If you are not a statistics or biostatistics graduate
 student, please chat with me if you're not sure if this course makes sense
 for you.
 A background in calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics is
 expected, as well as a basic ability to operate on a computer (but not
 necessary a UNIX variant).
 Furthermore, I'm expecting you will know the basics of R, at the level
 of the material in the R bootcamp offered Aug.
 23-24, 2014 [specifically the material in Modules 1-4, 6, but don't worry
 about environments and scoping].
 If you don't have that background you'll need to spend time in the initial
 couple weeks getting up to speed.
 All the material and screencasts from the bootcamp will be available, we'll
 have a hands-on practice session, and the GSI can also provide assistance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Objectives of the course

When to see us about an assignment
\series default
: We're here to help, including providing guidance on assignments.
 You don't want to be futilely spinning your wheels for a long time getting
 nowhere.
 That said, before coming to see us about a difficulty, you should try something
 a few different ways and try to define/summarize what is going wrong or
 where you are getting stuck.

Course websites: Github, Piazza, and bCourses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All course materials will be posted on Github at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2014"

\end_inset

.
 Class will follow a set of course notes with demonstrations.
 I will do my best to post the slides and demo code for class by 6 pm the
 day before class.
 I will not print out copies, so please bring your own copies if you want
 them in front of you.
 Note that each unit will have a single set of notes and demo code that
 I will add to as we move through the unit, so you may want to just print
 out the new pages.
 I'll provide PDF documents as well as the underlying Lyx file I used to
 generate the document.
 If you want a plain Latex version, open the Lyx file in Lyx and do 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use Piazza for communication (announcements and questions).
 You should ask questions about class material and problem sets through
 the course Piazza website, which you can find as a tab on the bCourses

 Please use this site for your questions so that either Jarrod or I can
 respond and so that everyone can benefit from the discussion.
 I encourage you to respond to each other's questions as well.
 I suggest you to modify your settings on Piazza so you are informed by
 email of postings.
 Questions of a personal nature can marked Private on Piazza.
 If you have a specific question you need to direct just to me, it's fine
 to email me directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have set up a course Wiki on Github, building off the Wiki from last year.
 The goal is to build up a useful set of webpages that provide tips on statistic
al computing and programming.
 So if you figure out a clever way to do something, find a useful R function
 or package, have a way to clean up the Wiki, or see a useful reference
 to link to, please contribute this to the Wiki.
 One way to get credit for class participation is to contribute to the Wiki.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll only make limited use of bCourses, mainly as a link to Piazza and
 to provide some basic information.

 Therefore, please check the site regularly.
 I will also make announcements and provide material through the website,
 with announcements also going out as email, so please check your email
 regularly.

Section
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jarrod will lead a one hour discussion section each week (there are two
 sections).
 The discussion sections will vary in format and topic but material will
 include demonstrations on various topics (version control, Python, debugging,
 etc.), discussion of relevant papers, and discussion of problem set solutions.
 If anyone cannot make either section time, please see me to discuss alternative
 arrangements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Computing Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most work for the course can be done on your laptop.
 We will also provide a Linux virtual machine (VM) with all required software
 that should eliminate any issues with installation and getting the necessary
 software.
 If you wish to do your assignments on your own machine rather than on the
 VM, keep in mind that it is your responsibility to get the required resources
 (such as being able to work in a UNIX terminal window) working on the your
 own computer.
 To use the VM, go to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://collaboratool.berkeley.edu/using-virtualbox.html"

\end_inset

.
 We can try to help with Windows-related issues but this help will necessarily
 be limited by our limited experience with Windows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those of you in Statistics can also make use of the Statistical Computing
 Facility (SCF) network of Linux and Mac computers.
 Anyone not in Statistics who would like an SCF account is also welcome
 to get one for the semester - see Chris for an account form.
 The computer rooms in 342 and 432 Evans provide Mac desktops; you can also
 remotely log in to the SCF system from other campus computers or from home.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software needed for the course is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Access to the UNIX command line (e.g., the Linux virtual machine, an SCF machine,
 or a Mac laptop)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Git
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
R (RStudio is recommended but by no means required)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Python (later in the course)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some tips for software installation are in the 'howtos' directory of the
 Git repository.
 In particular there are instructions for setting up the VM on your personal
 machine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Class time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My goal is to have classes be an interactive environment.
 This is both more interesting for all of us and more effective in learning
 the material.
 I encourage you to ask questions and will pose questions to the class to
 think about and discuss.
 
\series bold
As further 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

encouragement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, at the start of each class I'll designate a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

panel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 3-4 (random) students who I have the option to call on during class
 to answer questions.

\series default
 That said, I would like everyone to participate in discussion and ask questions
 regardless of who is on the panel in a given class.
 To increase time for discussion and assimilation of the material in class,
 before some classes I may ask that you read material in advance of class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please do not use phones during class and limit laptop use to the material
 being covered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Student backgrounds with computing will vary.
 For those of you with limited background on a topic, I encourage you to
 ask questions during class so I know what you find confusing.
 For those of you with extensive background on a topic (there will invariably
 be some topics where one of you will know more about it than I do), I encourage
 you to pitch in with your perspective.
 In general, there are many ways to do things on a computer, particularly
 in a UNIX environment, so it will help everyone (including me) if we hear
 multiple perspectives/ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, I will try to remember to post screencasts of the material on the
 berkeley-scf YouTube channel for those of you who miss a class or want
 to review it.
 These will necessarily be more effective for the computer demos and will
 miss material that I write on the board.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Course requirements and grading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Course grades
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grade for this course is primarily based on computer assignments due
 every 1 to 1.5 weeks and a final group project.
 The assignments will be frequent but each of them should be fairly short.
 There is no final exam.
 90% of the grade is based on the assignments and project (the project will
 count equal to about two problem sets) and 10% of the grade is based on
 class participation, with class participation also serving to distinguish
 borderline cases and in cases of exceptional participation to bump grades
 up.
 I will also occasionally pose questions/challenges to the class for discussion
 at the next class period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grades will generally be As and Bs.
 An A involves doing all the work, getting full credit on most of the problem
 sets, doing a thorough job on the final project, and participating in class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Class participation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class participation portion of the grade can be satisfied in one or
 more of the following ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
asking and answering questions in class (including when you are on the panel
 for a given class period),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
contributing to class discussion through the Piazza site, and/or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
contributing to the course Wiki on Github.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I may also provide extra credit questions on the problem sets.
 Extra credit can make up for limited class participation (and for points
 taken off on other problems).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Problem sets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will be less willing to help you if you come to our office hours or Piazza
 at the last minute.
 Working with computers can be unpredictable, so give yourself plenty of
 time for the assignments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several rules for submitting your assignments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You should prepare your assignments using either Latex plus knitr or R Markdown
 (the latter should not be used if you are a Statistics student).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Problem set submission consists of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A paper copy submitted to Chris at the start of class on the due date, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An electronic copy of the PDF, code file, and Markdown/knitr document, following
 the instructions to be provided by Jarrod.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Answers should consist of textual response or mathematical expressions as
 appropriate, with key chunks of code embedded within the document.
 Extensive additional code can be provided as an appendix.
 
\series bold
Raw code without explanation is not an appropriate solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Any mathematical derivations may be done by hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: knitr is a tool that allows one to embed chunks of code within Latex
 documents.
 It can also be used with the LyX GUI front-end to Latex.
 R Markdown is an extension to the Markdown markup language that allows
 one to embed R code within an HTML document.
 We will provide some tips about this on the first problem set and in the
 first section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm also open to you defining your own assignment for a given topic, if
 you are working on a specific problem.
 E.g., instead of working on a particular text manipulation problem I assign,
 you might work with your own text data.
 Check with me before forging ahead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Problem set grading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grading scheme for problem sets is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
0 = no credit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1 = partial credit (you did some of the problems but not all)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2 = satisfactory (you tried everything but there were pieces of what you
 did that didn't solve one or more problems in a complete way)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3 = full credit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you turn in a PS late, I'll bump you down a number.
 If you turn it in really late (i.e., after I start grading them), I may bump
 you down two levels.
 No credit after solutions are distributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Final project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final project will be a joint coding project in groups of 3-4.
 I'll assign an overall task, and you'll be responsible for dividing up
 the work, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation.
 You'll need to use the Git version control system for working in your group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rules for working together and the campus honor code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I encourage you to work together and help each other out, in the context
 of the following guidelines.
 In terms of questions/challenges posed in class that we'll discuss at the
 next class, anything goes.
 In terms of the problem sets, you should first try to figure out a given
 problem on your own.
 After that, if you're stuck or want to explore alternative approaches,
 feel free to consult with your fellow students and with Jarrod and me.
 You can share tips on general strategy or syntax for how to do individual
 tasks within a problem, but 
\series bold
you should not ask for nor share complete code or solutions
\series default
 for a problem.
 Basically, you can help each other out, but no one should be doing the
 work for someone else.
 In particular, 
\series bold
your solution to a problem set (writeup and code) must be your own
\series default
, and you'll hear from me if either look too similar to someone else's.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please see the last section of this document for more information on the
 Campus Honor Code, which I expect you to follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Feedback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I welcome comments and suggestions (and gripes) and will solicit feedback
 via a survey partway through the class.
 Comments at any other time are welcome, and if you prefer anonymity, you
 can leave a note in my mailbox or under my door.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Guidelines for Assignments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The grade for this course is determined by four computer projects related
 to the material covered in class.
 Some of the assignments may seem deceptively easy, but try to avoid putting
 the assignments off until the last possible minute.
 One of the most important things to learn about programming is that it
 is an unpredictable venture, and a simple task often takes more time than
 you would think at first glance.
 The purpose of the assignments is to give you an opportunity to write real
 programs which solve real problems.
 Your goal should not be to simply put together a program which gets the
 right answer for a particular set of data, but to develop a programming
 style which will allow you to be comfortable in solving problems which
 you will encounter in your future work.
 You may find it useful to use a word processing program like LaTeX when
 writing your reports, but this is not required.
 If you have an interest in learning how to produce attractive electronically
 typeset documents, this may be a good time to learn, but the focus of these
 assignments is not to produce a pretty report.
 Each assignment should consist of the following sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 An introduction, explaining in your own words what the goal of the program
 is, and a brief overview of your strategy in solving the problem.
 In other words, this first section should outline the reasoning you used
 as you figured out how to get the assignment completed.
 2.
 You should include in your assignments the complete source code of the
 program which you wrote to solve to the problem.
 3.
 Please provide a copy of the actual output of your program, as well as
 a copy of any input data, or a description of the data if it is very large
 or provided as part of the assignment.
 If there are parts of the output which are not self-explanatory, please
 be sure to annotate them so I can figure out what you are doing.
 4.
 Each assignment should contain a conclusion, which answers any specific
 questions raised in the assignment, as well as reporting on any interesting
 findings which you made while you were working on the assignment.
 If you feel you've encountered a principle or concept which has helped
 you understand things better, please don't hesitate to mention it, both
 for your own clarification, and so that I can get a better idea of how
 you are approaching the tasks at hand.
 5.
 The prefered method for submitting your assignments is to email me (at
 spector@stat.berkeley.edu), with a clear indication in the subject line that
 you are submitting an assignment for Stat 243.
 Your submission should have a PDF, OpenOffice document, or Word file containing
 your report.
 If necessary, you can include a single archive (zip, rar, tar, etc.) containing
 any other files which you feel are relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Your report need not be in any standardized format, but all of the above
 information should be included, and you may find it convenient to organize
 your work into the four sections described above.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The following is the Campus Honor Code.
 With regard to collaboration and independence, please see my rules regarding
 problem sets earlier in this document -- Chris.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:
 “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity,
 and respect for others.” The hope and expectation is that you will adhere
 to this code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials
 and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with
 fellow students.
 This is recommended.
 However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed
 independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result
 of one’s own independent work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no
 one would ever imagine that you would even consider cheating.
 Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a
 failing grade in the course and will also be reported to the University
 Center for Student Conduct.
 In order to guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep
 your eyes on your own materials and do not converse with others during
 the quizzes and exams.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate
 reference is plagiarism and will result in a failing grade for your assignment
 and usually further disciplinary action.
 For additional information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for
 example: http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Academic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two
 common examples of dishonest, unethical behavior.
 Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life.
 They help to build a sense of self-confidence, and are key to building
 trust within relationships, whether personal or professional.
 There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines
 what we are dedicated to doing – furthering knowledge for the benefit of
 humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion
 for learning and replete with fulfilling activities.
 And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful.
 There may be times when there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating
 in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your career.
 This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam,
 or submitting a written assignment that has been copied from another source.
 And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow student’s exam when you
 are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation.
 One might do any of these things and potentially not get caught.
 However, if you cheat, no matter how much you may have learned in this
 class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all.
