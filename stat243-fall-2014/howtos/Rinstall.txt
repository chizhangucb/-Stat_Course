 To install R, see:

    Mac: install the R-3.1.1-snowleopard.pkg from http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/ (or the Mavericks package if you have OS X 10.9)
    Windows: http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
    Linux: http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/

Then install RStudio. To do so, see http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop.

Verify that you can install add-on R packages by installing the 'fields' package. In RStudio, go to 'Tools→Install Packages'. In the resulting dialog box, enter 'fields' (without quotes) in the 'Packages' field. Depending on the location specified in the 'Install to Library' field, you may need to enter your administrator password. To be able to install packages to the directory of an individual user, you may need to do the following:

    In R, enter the command “Sys.getenv()['R_LIBS_USER']” without the double quotes.
    Create the directory specified in the result that R returns, e.g., on a Mac, this might be ~/Library/R/3.1/library.
