These instructions are for use on the class VM. You can run the Spark EC2 script from your own laptop but you may need to figure some things out on your own. However I expect these instructions may well work just fine for Macs.

0) As noted in (7) below, it's important that you delete your cluster when you're not actively using it. Don't leave it running overnight or while you go off for a few hours, as you'll use up the credits we have for the course.

1) To download Spark, go to https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html, choose 
* 1.1.0
* source code
* direct download 

Click on link in #4 entry. Download to the VM and untar/zip the file.

2) Create UNIX environment variables containing your AWS credentials based on the stat243-fall-2014-credentials.boto file:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=`grep aws_access_key_id stat243-fall-2014-credentials.boto | cut -d' ' -f3`
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`grep aws_secret_access_key stat243-fall-2014-credentials.boto | cut -d' ' -f3`

3) Put your private SSH key file on the VM, ideally in ~/.ssh. Change permissions on the file:
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/stat243-fall-2014-ssh_key.pem

4) Navigate to spark-1.1.0/ec2 and start a spark cluster, specifying the number of worker nodes you want in your Spark cluster:
export NUMBER_OF_WORKERS=12
./spark-ec2 -k <your_aws_username>@berkeley.edu:stat243-fall-2014 -i ~/.ssh/stat243-fall-2014-ssh_key.pem --region=us-west-2 -w 300 -s ${NUMBER_OF_WORKERS} -v 1.1.0 launch sparkvm-<your_name>

Occasionally you'll get some error messages and things won't start up correctly.  Just kill the cluster and try again. You might increase the number after the "-w" to increase the wait time that the Spark script uses to allow the Amazon instances to start up.

5) Once it has finished (it will take 5-15 minutes), you can login as follows:
./spark-ec2 -k <your_aws_username>@berkeley.edu:stat243-fall-2014 -i stat243-fall-2014-ssh_key.pem --region=us-west-2 login sparkvm-<your_name>

6) Now you can follow the template provided in the Unit 9 class notes to use Spark

6a) If you experience problems like I had in class with the connection to the VM closing, this may be interruption due to a bad wireless connection. Here's something that can help. As soon as you login to your instance, type "screen -x -RR". This will put you in a shell session that you'll be able to go back to even if you lose your connection. If you lose the connection then when you connect back to the master node, type "screen -x -RR" again and you should be back where you were.

7) IMPORTANT: delete your cluster as soon as you are done with it. We only have a limited number of credits for everyone in the class to use.

./spark-ec2 --region=us-west-2 --delete-groups destroy sparkvm-<your_name>
