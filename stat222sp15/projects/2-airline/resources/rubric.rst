Statistics 222 grading rubric
=============================

For the second project you will need to present your group poster
in class on Wednesday, February 25th.

While preparing your poster, please refer to Cari's lecture from Monday,
regarding the format and content of your poster. In particular,
you should review the original poster competition results:

* http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/posters/

You should include figures and text in your poster.  Your poster
should be organized into appropriate sections.  Your figures must be labeled
and captioned.  While you will present your group poster, the
poster should be sufficiently detailed that the main ideas are apparent
without additional verbal explanation.  However, you should aim to keep
the text to a minimum.  For instance, instead of using sentences to explain
how you analyzed the data, you might use a diagram.  When you do need
to use text to explain something, see if you can use short phrases
to convey the information rather than writing out whole sentences.
Use your judgment and discuss how best to present the information
with your group.

Below is the grading rubric we will be using to assess your submissions. To
receive the equivalent of an "A" on this assignment your group will need to have
roughly two check marks and two check pluses.
