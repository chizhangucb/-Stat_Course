### Labs

- Lab discussion is a required part of the class and is meant to supplement lecture.
- You must attend the discussion group you are officially registered in.
- You will be encouraged to problem solve individually or in groups.
- Your lab score will be based on attedance (50%) and submission (50%).
- To receive full credit, you must attend the lab (50%), complete the lab assignment, and submit the lab assignment on bcourses (50%).
- If you didn't finish the assignment during the lab session, you can still get full credit by submitting a completed assignment on bcourses before Friday 11:59pm of the same week as the lab session.
- Each person must submit each lab independently, but you are welcome to collaborate with other students in your lab room.
- There may be some short quizzes given in discussion to test your understanding.
- Your quiz scores __will NOT__ be part of your grade.



### Assignments

All assignments (Problem Sets) will involve writing a combination of code, actual prose, and math notation. You must submit your assignment in a format which allows for the combination of the two, and the automatic execution of all your code. The easiest way to do this is to use R Markdown. 

- Assignments will be assigned almost every two weeks (about 6 HW).
- You will submit your homework to bCourses: typically your `Rmd` source file and the knitted output.
- Don't wait until the last hour to do an assignment. Plan ahead and pace yourself.
- __No late assignments__ will be accepted, for any reason, including, but not limited to, Internet congestion, system crashes, natural disasters, theft, medical emergencies, personal crisis, theft or any extraordinary circumnstances (e.g. illnes, exhaustion, mourning, loss of internet connection, bCourses is down, broken computer). Don't ask. I won't be sympathetic.
- If you collaborate with other students when working on an assignment, please include the names of those students in your submission.
- You must write your own answers (using your own words, and your own coding style). Copy and plagiarism will not be tolerated (see _Academic Honesty_ policy).



### Assignments Grading

- The primary way that the homework will be graded is by yourselves.
- You need to turn in both your code and written solutions in the form of an `.Rmd` file and the corresponding knitted file (.`html` or `.pdf` format).
- Any homework submissions that are turned in without both the `.Rmd` file and the knitted file, will receive a zero.
- __No late submission:__ Submissions after 11:59 PM of the HW deadline will not be accepted.
- If you have any questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to office hours.
- After the HW deadline, official solutions will be posted on bCourses. You will then be expected to read them and enter your own scores and comments for (every part) of every problem in the homework on a simple coarse scale:
    + __0__ = Didn't attempt or very very wrong,
    + __2__ = Got started and made some progress, but went off in the wrong direction or with no clear direction,
    + __5__ = Right direction and got half-way there,
    + __8__ = Mostly right but a minor thing missing or wrong,
    + __10__ = 100% correct.

- Note: You must justify every self-grade score with a comment. If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jc9h3iwt5m42zz). This is not supposed to be a stressful process.
- Your self-grades will be due three days after the homework deadline at 11:59 PM sharp.
- We will accept late self-grades up to a week after the original homework deadline for half credit on the associated homework assignment.
- If you don't enter a proper grade by this deadline, you are giving yourself a zero on that assignment.
- Merely doing the homework is not enough, you must do the homework; turn it in on time; read the solutions; do the self-grade; and turn it in on time. Unless all of these steps are done, you will get a zero for that assignment.



### Piazza

- We will use Piazza as a Q&A forum (and for some official announcements).
- To join piazza follow this link [piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/stat154](piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/stat154)
- If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructor or GSIs.
- Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you should make your post private (visible to instructors only).
- See the [Piazza Etiquette](piazza.md) section for more on using Piazza. 



### Tests

- There will be one 50-minute in-class midterm, and one final exam.
- The tentative date of the midterm is TBD.
- The midterm exam will be held in class (during lecture period). Tentative date on Friday, March 9. 
- The final exam will be held from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Tuesday May 8, as scheduled by the university, in a room to be announced.
- If you do not take the final, you will NOT pass the class.
- Unless you have accommodations as determined by the university, you must take the midterm and the final at the dates and times provided here.
- Please check your course schedule and make sure that you have no conflicts with these exams.There will be __no early or makeup exams__. 
- Do not take the class if you are not available at these dates and times.
- We will use gradescope to grade the tests.
- You will have three full days after grades are published on gradescope to request a regrade for the midterm. The final test is NOT eligible for regrades.
- Please only ask for regrades if you see an error in the grading rather than a dispute with the rubric.
- In case of regrading, we will regrade your entire test.
- During the regrading process you can lose points, even for questions you did not ask to be regraded.
- Regrades are based on what you actually wrote, not on what you were thinking, or what you meant to say, or what you assumed or failed to assume.
- After the regrade deadline, no requests will be considered, even if there was an error in the grading.



### Oral Evaluation

- I reserve the right to have a meeting with you and evaluate your understanding of the material in person (oral examination, whiteboard coding, and live coding).
- Testing in person can happen haphazardly (most of the time), but it can also occur based on special circumstances (e.g. grad students, unusual programming background, allegedly cheating/plagiarism, unusual low or high performance).
- The purpose of this evaluation is for me to have a more direct way of assessing your entire work (e.g. knowledge, skills, thinking process, problem solving).



### Grading Structure

- Labs: 10%
- Homework: 50%
- Midterm: 10%
- Final Exam: 30%
- Oral Evaluation: ?

No individual letter grades will be given for midterm, or final. You will get a letter grade for the course that is based on your overall score.



### Learning Cooperatively

With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the course staff informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don't just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't finish.



### Academic Honesty

Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not share your code or answers directly with other students. Doing so doesn't help them; it just sets them up for trouble on exams. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partner and turn in one project between you. For more information please read the [Honor Code Guide for Syllabi](http://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/general/hc_guide_for_syllabi.pdf).

I (Gaston Sanchez) expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together---but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). If you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. 

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.



### Email Policy

- You should try to use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Stat 154 Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- I prefer to have conversations in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.



### Special Accommodations

Students needing accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, should speak with me during the first two weeks of the semester, either after class or during office hours and see [http://dsp.berkeley.edu](http://dsp.berkeley.edu) to learn about Berkeley’s policy. If you are a DSP student, please contact me at least three weeks prior to a midterm or final so that we can work out acceptable accommodations via the DSP Office.

If you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar and come see me as soon as possible to OH during the first two weeks of the semester. Do not take the class if you are not available to take the midterm, final, and/or attend lab discussions. I won't be able to provide accommodation for a late exam (No coaching staff proctoring).



### Incomplete Policy

Under emergency/special circumstances, students may petition me to receive an Incomplete grade. By University policy, for a student to get an Incomplete requires (i) that the student was performing __passing-level work__ until the time that (ii) something happened that---through no fault of the student---prevented the student from completing the coursework. If you take the final, you completed the course, even if you took it while ill, exhausted, mourning, etc. The time to talk to me about incomplete grades is BEFORE you take the final, when the situation that prevents you from finishing presents itself. Please clearly state your reasoning in your comments to me.

It is your responsibility to develop good time management skills, good studying habits, know your limits, and learn to ask for professional help.
Life happens. Social, family, cultural, scholar, and individual circumstances can affect your performance (both positive and negatively). If you find yourself in a situation that raises concerns about passing the course, please come see me as soon as possible. Above all, please do not wait till the end of the semester to share your concerns about passing the course because it will be too late by then.



### Safe, Supportive, and Inclusive Environment

Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or GSI is responsible for 
the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a 
romantic or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. 
Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.

Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you 
should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus 
policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this 
policy, you may contact the _Confidential Care Advocates_ on campus for support 
related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be
made by calling (510) 642-1988.

The classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments 
for everyone. The _Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination_ 
(OPHD) is responsible for ensuring the University provides an environment for 
faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on 
the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, 
gender identity, and sexual orientation. Questions or concerns? 
Call (510) 643-7985, email ask_ophd@berkeley.edu, or go to 
[http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/](http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/).



### Letters of Recommendation

Unless I have known you at least one year, and we have developed a good collegial relationship, I do not provide letters of recommendation. 



### Additional Course Policies

- Be sure to pay attention to deadlines.
- In consideration to everybody in the classroom, please turn off your cell phone during class and lab time.



### Fine Print

The course deadlines, assignments, exam times and material are subject to change at the whim of the professor.
